          Traveling around the world at once is often a cheaper option than
          breaking it down into segments. The secret is to plan carefully and
          purchase the ticket well in advance. The cost is more than made up for
          by the amazing experience of seeing many places in a short period of
          time and the memories you'll have for a lifetime.
